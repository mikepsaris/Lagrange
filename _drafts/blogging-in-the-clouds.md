Now that I have this blog up and running, I thought I'd share some of what I learned. 

For starters, I've done everything on my Chromebook. If you're not familiar with chromebooks, they're lightweight computers that run Google's Chrome operating system. Google created the Chrome OS because they realized most of us spend most of our time on a computer in a browser checking our personal or work email, updating our facebook status, monitoring our finances, and planning our next vacation; none of which requires beefy hardware. While it's nice to have beefy hardware, the price point for chromebooks is well worth the sacrifice, and now that Chromebooks can run android apps, you won't be missing out on the funtionality you get from tablets and smart phones. One nice feature specific to my ASUS Flip is its touch screen that rotates 365 degrees. This means that so long as you're OK with a 10.1 inch screen, which I am, you can use it like a tablet, and do all the tablet things you enjoy doing.

Once I settled into my new Chromebook, I began figuring out how to overhaul my website which was hosted on github pages. I wanted to use jekyll to run my blog, but jekyll runs in ruby. This isn't a problem if your on a mac or a linux machine, but chromebooks are a different story. While Chromebooks use the linux kernal, getting root access is not easy, and while I'm sure some hardcore developers and computer geeks will call this a copout, I'm simply not interested in mucking around with my Chromebook in that way. 

So, I did some searching and found some recommendations to use a cloud ide.
